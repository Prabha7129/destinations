    <p id="p-b">Tirupati is a city in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. Its Sri Venkateswara Temple sits atop one of the the 7 peaks of Tirumala Hills, attracting scores of Hindu pilgrims. Sri Venkateswara National Park, home to the temple, also contains the Sri Venkateswara Zoological Park with lions and primates. Nearby, next to a waterfall and cave believed to be sacred, Sri Kapileswara Swamy Temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva. </p>

    <p id="p-b">Tirumala hills are part of Seshachalam Hills range. The hills are 853 metres (2,799 ft) above sea level and comprise seven peaks, representing the seven heads of Adisesha. The temple lies on the seventh peakâ€”Venkatadri, on the southern banks of Sri Swami Pushkarini, a holy water tank. Hence the temple is also referred to as "Temple of Seven Hills".</p>
    <h3 id="h3-b">Talakona Waterfall </h3>
    <p id="p-b">The waters of Talakona are enriched with herbs and people believe that it has healing properties. A long and treacherous trekking route leads to the top of the hill, which can be reached by multiple paths. Talakona hills geographically is considered a part of the Eastern Ghats.

        There is a beautiful waterfall falling deep into the valley from a cliff on the upper reaches. According to the local residents, it is said that the origin of water is difficult to be traced out since an underground stream surfaces here.</p>
    <h3 id="h3-b">Sri Venkateswara Zoological Park</h3>
    <p id="p-b">This ia actually a zoological park in forest like habitat for animals but well guarded with some fencing...

        You are allowed to take own car inside campus at additional coat Rs500 + entry ticket + camera/mobile etc.,
        
        Also u can use battery cars, hire bicycles and lion safari at additional cost..
        
        This almost resembles like Vandaloor zoo in chennai in terms of setup.. Still needs more maintenance..
        
        Kids will enjoy the visit.. we spotted deers, jaguar, sloth bear, white tiger, indian wolf during our drive(5-6kms) inside zoo.</p>
