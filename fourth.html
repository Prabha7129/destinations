 <p id="p-c">The name Hyderabad means "Haydar's City" or "Lion City", from haydar 'lion' and ābād 'city', after Caliph Ali Ibn Abi Talib, also known as Haydar because of his lion-like valour in battle. The city was originally called Baghnagar ("city of gardens").The European travellers von Poser and Thévenot found both names in use in the 17th century.</p>
